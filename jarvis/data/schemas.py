    A price is observable when it is a real, finite number **strictly greater than
    zero**. Both halves matter and both were missing:

    * `float("nan")` compares False against everything, so a NaN price passes every
      `>` / `>=` threshold silently.
    * `0.0` is finite, so a "is this a number" check alone admits it — and a zero
      *entry* makes the inverted-geometry comparisons (`stop_loss >= entry`) False,
      which is how a **negative** stop loss came to be accepted.

    `market_context.build_context` produces exactly `current_price = bid = 0.0` when
    the primary frame is empty (feed down, cold symbol), so a zero price is not
    hypothetical: it is what an unobserved market looks like in this system. Callers
    must treat a False result as "no market data", never as "a price of zero".
